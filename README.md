## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **LIFE.PTML**, a methodology integrating:

- **Lifecycle (L)**  
- **Information Fusion (IF)**  
- **Encoding (E)**  
- **Perturbation Theory (PT)**  
- **Machine Learning (ML)**  

The goal is to develop predictive models of compound activity targeting **calmodulin (CaM) and related proteins**.

The dataset comprises **3,748 molecule‚Äìassay combinations**, combining chemical and protein descriptors. Several classifiers were tested (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, etc.), with **XGBoost** achieving the best performance:

- **Test Accuracy**: 88.9%  
- **ROC AUC**: 0.959  

Feature importance analysis revealed contributions from both **drug- and protein-level descriptors**, confirming the robustness of the methodology.
